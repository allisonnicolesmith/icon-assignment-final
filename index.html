        <p>According to the <a href="https://blog.leeandlow.com/2020/01/28/2019diversitybaselinesurvey/">2019 Diversity Baseline Survey from Lee & Low Books</a>, 76% of publishing staff, review journal staff, and literary agents self-identified as
          White. The remaining 24% self-reported as non-White. In comparison, 79% of respondents in <a href="https://blog.leeandlow.com/2016/01/26/where-is-the-diversity-in-publishing-the-2015-diversity-baseline-survey-results/">2015</a>
          self-reported as White, which would suggest the industry became less racially diverse in the last four years. Lee & Low Books received
          approximately 7,875 responses from book industry employees. <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/81718-the-pw-publishing-industry-salary-survey-2019.html">Publisher Weekly’s 2019
            Industry Salary Survey</a>, which received 699 responses from employees at publishing houses only, reported that 84% of employees were White.

        <p>Last year, in response to a campaign waged by Waterstone’s staff for a real living wage, the CEO, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/08/waterstones-staff-living-wage-petition-james-daunt">James Daunt</a>, said, “To retain
          the best and most talented booksellers, we have to reward them, and we reward them as well as we can with pay,
          but we mainly reward them with a stimulating job.”</p>

        <p>In addition to the <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/09/skyhorse-publishings-house-of-horrors">erasure and stigmatization of unions in the book industry</a>, management justifies low wages because employees are “doing what
          they
          love.” This, combined with the scarcity of and competition for jobs in publishing and bookselling, fosters a submissive workforce that is largely averse to rocking the boat.</p>

        <p>According to <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/81718-the-pw-publishing-industry-salary-survey-2019.html">Publisher Weekly’s 2019 Industry Salary Survey</a>, 42% of non-White
          respondents said they were either extremely or very satisfied with their jobs, compared to 50% of White participants. Of those who were
          somewhat or not satisfied with their jobs, a majority (68% of non-Whites and 62% of Whites) cited low salary as their chief complaint.</p>

        <p>Being able to accept lower wages in order to “do what you love” is a privilege, but of the entirely wrong kind. By failing to financially incentivize its employees, the book industry fosters hyper-exclusivity, catering to a labor class
          comprised of the comparitively wealthy, while ensuring that those from less advantageous backgrounds are either barred from entry or are not adequately supported in order to stay long-term.

        <p>One of the major roadblocks in the way of bridging the gap between labor and diversity in the book industry is transparency. If you Google, for example, “Penguin Random House CEO salary” the best numbers you can find are estimates. The
          estimates state that the PRH CEOs make about $250k per year, and that’s almost certainly lower than the reality of their salaries, especially once you factor in bonuses. Wage transparency is vital for two reasons: first, to galvanize people
          to make a change, and second to make sure that the changes that do get made are ones that result in a more level playing field.
        <p>
          Circulating among the book industry is a guerilla spreadsheet called <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p9y99EpfTDKZBi6FqPrFg9jvPcZObTTjY8LpkU2-1SI/edit?usp=sharing">“Book Money”</a> in which book workers anonymously
          contribute their
          job information, namely the particular role at which particular publisher and what they get paid for their particular role. According to this Google Sheet, the average starting salary (within the last 5 years) for an editorial assistant in
          New York City is $35,721. In contrast, according to the <a href="https://www.naceweb.org/job-market/compensation/average-salary-for-class-of-2019-up-almost-6-percent-over-class-of-2018s/">National Association of Colleges and Employers
            (NACE)</a>, the average starting salary in 2019 for graduates with a bachelor’s degree is $53,889. Across the book industry as a whole, the average White employee earns $54,043 per year, whereas non-White
          employees average $47,443 per year.
        <p>
          There is a misguided notion among publishing workers that low wages are indicative of a struggling business model, and that to ask for more, collectively, would endanger the industry itself. However, the assumption that low
          wages are the only thing keeping the industry afloat is not supported by the numbers. In July, the Association of American Publishers (AAP) released their annual <a
            href="https://publishers.org/news/aap-statshot-annual-report-book-publishing-revenues-up-slightly-to-25-93-billion-in-2019/">StatShot report for the year 2019</a>, which estimated that the book publishing industry generated $25.93 billion
          in revenue, up by 1.1% from 2018.

        <p>According to data from the <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/how-todays-unions-help-working-people-giving-workers-the-power-to-improve-their-jobs-and-unrig-the-economy/">Economic Policy Institute (EPI)</a>, the larger the share of
          the American workforce that’s unionized, the lower the share of national income that goes to the super-rich — and vice versa. In 1956, union density reached its peak at 33.2%. At this time, 31.8% of workers’ share of income went to the top
          10%.
          By comparison, union density saw an all-time low at 11.1% in 2015. And 47.8% of the national income went to the top 10% . Collective bargaining is necessary for income equality, especially for low- and middle-wage workers.
